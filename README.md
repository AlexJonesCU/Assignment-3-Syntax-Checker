I also attempted throwing exceptions for the errors and they would work for the errors. When there was an error the running code would complete and print the errors, however if there were no errors I could not get the ok message to display or the code to end, so I ended up just displaying the messages as the delimiter errors would arise. For future reference I used the source below as well as the textbook to try to add errors. I wanted to save this source here for future programs.
